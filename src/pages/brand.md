### About

Hi, I'm Mikael Lirbank. I build robust, reliable, high-quality AI systems. I care deeply about quality—AI evals, robust test suites, clean data models, and clean architecture.

Need help building elegant systems? I'm happy to help.

### Experience

#### Mikael Lirbank: Independent Consultant

I partner with companies to design and deliver robust, high-quality AI systems. My consulting practice emphasizes evaluation, testing, and architecture — AI evals, test suites, clean data models, and reliable infrastructure — so teams can move fast without breaking things.

Through hands-on engineering and close collaboration, I help organizations turn complex requirements into elegant, maintainable systems that scale.
