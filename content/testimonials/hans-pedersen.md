Mikael did a great job with our project. He provided excellent documentation and handed over all of the necessary information.

He also worked with my to make sure my AWS S3 was setup properly and found solutions before and during the project that allow our web app to re-launch and to be cost effective.

Very solid person and developer. Excellent communication and that is key for me.
