I've recently spent six years as a tech lead, engineering manager, and product inventor within the **Applied AI Venture Studio** at [BootstrapLabs, an Ares Management company](https://www.aresmgmt.com/), a venture capital firm investing in applied AI. During this time, I led a series of applied AI projects.

Here are a few favorite AI applications I've built or been a main contributor to.

### STΛR MODΞ

Built from the ground up as an AI-first, humanless bookkeeper that handles financial business accounting without human intervention. Powered by OpenAI APIs and custom data pipelines, STΛR MODΞ employs a next-gen AI-driven user interface with voice input and voice+screen output.
