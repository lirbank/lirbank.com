**A structured approach to building quality software with AI**

AI dramatically accelerates software development, but how it is used often compromises quality and structure. Without a clear process, AI-generated code can become inconsistent and difficult to maintain.

In my recent work, I've been developing a way to use AI to write high-quality, well-tested, and high-performing code really fast. This approach is inspired by my work building PimDB, a browser-based persisted in-memory database. In this talk, we'll explore a structured process to empower teams to leverage AI to tackle complex projects with incredible velocity without compromising on quality.

We'll cover:

1. API design and architecture
2. Writing tests
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Writing documentation
5. Implementation and optimization

Attendees will gain practical strategies for using AI to write maintainable, reliable code at AI speed—without compromising on quality.
