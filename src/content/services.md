## Things I'd love to take off your plate

### Hands-on web app development

I love building web apps from scratch, and I'm great at fixing up broken ones, too. I'm happy to work solo or alongside your existing dev team, to ship a well-crafted web application.

If your app needs a modern look or a smoother experience, I can refresh the design and create a consistent design system that your users will appreciate.

### Deployment and quality assurance

A bug-free, fast, and stable app that is a delight to use starts with robust test automation. I set up test automation to eliminate regressions and keep your app thoroughly tested, from integration to end-to-end testing. Quality is at the heart of what I do, and I'm happy to get your team up to speed with test-driven development if that's a focus.

I'll also streamline your deployment process, setting up a reliable release pipeline—whether you're using Vercel, Heroku, GitHub Actions, or another service—so you can release with confidence.

### Tech strategy, architecture, and stack optimization

Choosing the right tech stack and architecture is key to a productive, scalable app. I'll work with you to select and optimize the technologies that best fit your goals, ensuring a solid foundation for growth and maintainability.

If your app is currently in JavaScript, I can convert it to TypeScript to improve reliability and reduce bugs. For projects that need a refresh, I'll clean up code, update dependencies, and streamline your setup to keep everything running smoothly.

### Leadership and product direction

With a relaxed but high-accountability approach to leadership, I help teams stay focused, aligned, and motivated. Whether guiding day-to-day work, mentoring individual developers, or setting long-term goals, I keep quality and consistency at the forefront.

As a product manager, I make sure every decision supports both business objectives and user needs, creating a clear path from concept to delivery. My approach brings peace of mind, knowing that your project is in good hands and moving in the right direction.
