            Mikael is a great developer with a natural interest and
            understanding in the business side of the applications, which makes
            it very easy to coop with him. He is fast, thorough and working

            I had the pleasure of working with Mikael on my company, BenAi, and
            he brought a whole new level of professionalism and polish to our
            software. From day one, he zeroed in on areas for improvement and
            took our platform from a prototype to a production-ready product of
            true enterprise quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            What stood out the most was Mikael's incredible attention to detail.
            He's always up-to-date on the latest technology trends and
            consistently recommends modern, high-performing solutions that have
            significantly improved the functionality and performance of our
            platform. He didn't just upgrade the code; he transformed our
            development process with a disciplined, organized approach that
            brought real structure to our team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mikael's work has elevated BenAi in ways I hadn't imagined. If you
            need someone who can turn ideas into robust, scalable solutions, I
            would highly recommend working with Mikael.

            We couldn't have asked for anything more from Mikael. We had a
            relatively difficult new application which needed to be built, on a
            short timeframe and to specific requirements. His approach was
            careful, considered and fast throughout.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is an excellent communicator and was able to work considerately,
            prioritise tasks appropriately and ask questions when needed. He
            understood the task well and he produced very high quality code, in
            line with all the best practices etc. - I am confident that his code
            will be running with us for a long time to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you Mikael for a job well done, we're looking forward to
            working with you again in the future.

          A structured approach to building quality software with AI
        </p>
        <p>
          AI dramatically accelerates software development, but how it is used
          often compromises quality and structure. Without a clear process,
          AI-generated code can become inconsistent and difficult to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my recent work, I've been developing a way to use AI to write
          high-quality, well-tested, and high-performing code really fast. This
          approach is inspired by my work building PimDB, a browser-based
          persisted in-memory database. In this talk, we'll explore a structured
          process to empower teams to leverage AI to tackle complex projects
          with incredible velocity without compromising on quality.
        </p>
        <p>We'll cover:</p>

          <li>Implementation and optimization</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Attendees will gain practical strategies for using AI to write
          maintainable, reliable code at AI speed—without compromising on
          quality.

            Mikael came to our company and gave a well-organized and highly
            informative talk to our developers about how to use AI to speed up
            software development in a practical way. Mikael has a knack for
            explaining complex ideas in a way that is very accessible, and our
            entire group was immediately inspired and empowered to use the
            emerging methodologies he showcased. I was super impressed!
