I had the pleasure of working with Mikael on my company, BenAi, and he brought a whole new level of professionalism and polish to our software. From day one, he zeroed in on areas for improvement and took our platform from a prototype to a production-ready product of true enterprise quality.

What stood out the most was Mikael's incredible attention to detail. He's always up-to-date on the latest technology trends and consistently recommends modern, high-performing solutions that have significantly improved the functionality and performance of our platform. He didn't just upgrade the code; he transformed our development process with a disciplined, organized approach that brought real structure to our team.

Mikael's work has elevated BenAi in ways I hadn't imagined. If you need someone who can turn ideas into robust, scalable solutions, I would highly recommend working with Mikael.
