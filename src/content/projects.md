## STΛR MODΞ

I run a software collective where we build open-source libraries, developer tools, and AI apps. Everything we ship reflects the same attention to detail and code quality I bring to client work.

- **neon-testing** — Postgres integration tests, dead simple
- **PimDB** — 4,000x faster in-browser database
- **Heartbeats** — The first humanless bookkeeper

**See the code, read the docs, try the tools** — this is how I build.

## Client projects

Over the past decade, I've built AI applications and ML tooling for venture-backed startups and enterprise clients—including work at the **Applied AI Venture Studio** of [BootstrapLabs, an Ares company](https://www.aresmgmt.com/).

Here are a few AI projects I've led or been a main contributor to.

### Scoutbee ISS

An AI-powered supplier search engine built for Fortune 50 procurement teams. Instant Supplier Search (ISS) enables buyers to find and evaluate suppliers across any category with natural-language queries and rich filtering. Designed for speed, precision, and scale in high-stakes sourcing workflows.

### BenAi

A dedicated AI-first chatbot for health benefits administrators (TPAs). BenAi ingests plan documents and claims data at the individual member level, using OpenAI LLMs and custom embeddings to provide accurate, member-specific answers on claims and coverage.

Built for TPA call centers, BenAi helps agents answer member questions faster and more accurately—reducing call times and escalations.

### Shorty

An AI-augmented communication platform that enhances team productivity by organizing conversations and interactions into a graph of nodes and edges. Integrated with OpenAI LLMs, Shorty relies on AI agents to summarize discussions, identify consensus points, and enable seamless decision-making support.
