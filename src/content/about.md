I'm Mikael Lirbank, based in Corte Madera, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area. I live here with my amazing wife and children. In my spare time, I'm a bit of a cycling fanatic, so if you'd ever want to go mountain biking or road cycling in Marin County, hit me up!

With over 20 years of experience, I've built a strong track record of building apps from scratch, rescuing existing ones, and leading development teams. I'm a tech lead, product manager, UI designer, and code quality expert, known for taking ownership of every project and delivering predictability and peace of mind to my clients.
