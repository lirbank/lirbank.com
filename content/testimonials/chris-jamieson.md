We couldn't have asked for anything more from Mikael. We had a relatively difficult new application which needed to be built, on a short timeframe and to specific requirements. His approach was careful, considered and fast throughout.

He is an excellent communicator and was able to work considerately, prioritise tasks appropriately and ask questions when needed. He understood the task well and he produced very high quality code, in line with all the best practices etc. - I am confident that his code will be running with us for a long time to come.

Thank you Mikael for a job well done, we're looking forward to working with you again in the future.
